<br>
<p>The Text Mangler is a desktop application, written in Java, that
allows a user to perform operations on rows of data.  You specify
the input data and a pattern, and the program applies the pattern
to each row of input data in order to generate the output.</p>

<p>Each row of input data is composed of a set of fields, typically
separated by a comma.  For example, if the input data is:

<pre>
   Bill,Cindy,David
   Sue,Cathy,Jim
</pre>

and the pattern is:

<pre>
   $1 and $2 know $3
</pre>

then the output is:

<pre>
   Bill and Cindy know David
   Sue and Cathy know Jim
</pre>
</p>

<p>There is a special variable that refers to the current line
number from the input data.  The variable is <b>$Row</b>.  By default,
its initial value and increment value are both 1, although
that can be modified (see below).</p>

<p>The application supports functions for field references (such
as $1).  These functions are <b>$upper()</b>, <b>$lower()</b> and
<b>$title()</b>.  These functions will change the case of their
argument to, respectively, uppercase, lowercase and titlecase
(only the first letter of each word is made uppercase). An
example is <b>$upper($1)</b>.</p>

<p>You can include <b>comments</b> in the pattern.  Comments are
not processed by the application, and not included in the output.
To mark a line as a comment, start the line with <b>$//</b>.</p>

<p><b>Conditionals</b> are also supported.  The supported
statements are <b>$if</b>, <b>$elseif</b>, <b>$else</b> and
<b>$endif</b>.  The conditional statement can either be of
the format <b>&quot;$Row [op] [#]&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;[string]
[op] [string]&quot;</b>.  Either string can be either a
literal, such as &quot;Sam&quot;, or a field reference, such as $1.
The supported operators are listed below.  The supported operators
for string comparisons and numeric comparisons are identical.  The
$if and $elseif statements require a condition argument, such as
<b>&quot;$if $Row = 5&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;$elseif
$1=&quot;Bob&quot;&quot;</b>.  An if-block can include as many
$elseif statements as you like.</p>

<p>The supported conditional operators are:</p>

<p>
<table border=2 align="center">
<tr align="center"><th>Operator(s)</th><th>Function</th></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>=, ==</td><td>Equal</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>!=, &lt;&gt;</td><td>Not equal</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>&lt;</td><td>Less than</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>&lt;=</td><td>Less than or equal</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>&gt;</td><td>Greater than</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>&gt;=</td><td>Greater than or equal</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>To see a demonstration of all of the above, change the pattern
in the drop-down listbox to <b>&quot;Demo&quot;</b>.</p>

<p>The Options tab has several configuration options available to
the user:

<ul>
<li><b>Trim each field</b> - Remove leading and trailing spaces and control charactes</li>
<li><b>Ignore first row</b> - Whether to ignore the first row</li>
<li><b>Column delimiters</b> - List of characters that can be a column delimiter in a
       row; any character in this field will be considered a column delimiter</li>
<li><b>Row delimiters</b> - List of characters that can be a row delimiter;
       any character in this field will be considered a row delimiter</li>
<li><b>Code symbol prefix</b> - The string that prefaces each field reference (e.g.,
       $1, $Row), required</li>
<li><b>Code symbol suffix</b> - The string that follows each field reference (e.g.,
       $1, $Row), not required</li>
<li><b>$Row initial value</b> - The value to initialize $Row to (for the first row)</li>
<li><b>$Row increment value</b> - The amount to increment $Row by for each row</li>
</ul>

The code symbol prefix and suffix only apply to field references (such as $1)
and $Row, not to the functions (such as $upper()) or the conditionals (such as $if).</p>

<p>The drop-down listbox of pattern choices can be modified by editing
the <b>mangler.ini</b> file.  To add a pattern, add a section with the
pattern name you want to appear in the drop-down listbox.  In that section,
add the line <b>&quot;Lines=[#]&quot;</b>, with Lines set to the number
of pattern lines in the section.  Then, add the pattern lines to the
section, with each line of the format <b>&quot;Line[#]=[string]&quot;</b>.
So, if the pattern is five lines, the first line would be &quot;Lines=5&quot;,
followed by five lines, starting with &quot;Line1=[string]&quot;,
&quot;Line2=[string]&quot;, &quot;Line3=[string]&quot;, &quot;Line4=[string]&quot;
and &quot;Line5=[string]&quot;, where [string] would be the pattern string
for each line.  For examples, see the mangler.ini file.</p>
